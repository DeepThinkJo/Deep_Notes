### Definition

```plain text
**Definition.**
Write the formal definition clearly using LaTeX.

Example:
Let V be a vector space. A subset W ⊆ V is a subspace if
1. 0 ∈ W,
2. x, y ∈ W ⇒ x + y ∈ W,
3. a ∈ F, x ∈ W ⇒ ax ∈ W.


```
### Your Explanation (Intuitive Commentary)

- Intuition behind the definition
- Why this formulation matters
- How to interpret it in your own words
### Theorem

```plain text
**Theorem.**
State the theorem precisely using LaTeX.

Example:
If T : V → W is linear, then Ker(T) and Range(T) are subspaces.


```
### Your Explanation

- Meaning of the theorem
- Why it works / intuition
- When and where it is useful
### Proof

```plain text
**Proof.**
Write the formal proof.
You may use block math:

$$
T(u + v) = T(u) + T(v)
$$


```
