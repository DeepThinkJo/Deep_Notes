# Chapter 1. Introduction to Programming and Python

As engineers, our goal is to **solve problems** by applying scientific principles and systematic thinking.

Computer engineering focuses on solving problems with the aid of computers—powerful tools capable of executing procedures quickly and reliably.

However, computers differ fundamentally from humans.

Humans can interpret vague instructions and understand context, but **computers require explicit, precise commands** to perform any task.

They cannot figure things out on their own; they must be told exactly what to do and how to do it.

Therefore, solving problems with computers requires more than intuition.

We must express our solution process in a way the computer can understand.

This activity is called **programming**.

We do not study Python to memorize syntax.

Our purpose is to learn **how to communicate problem-solving ideas to a computer**.

Python is one tool—a programming language that allows us to express solutions clearly and effectively.

Ultimately, our goal is not to accumulate knowledge, but to build the ability to **use computation to solve real problems**.

This chapter provides the conceptual foundation for understanding computers, programming, and why Python is such an effective tool for modern engineering.
