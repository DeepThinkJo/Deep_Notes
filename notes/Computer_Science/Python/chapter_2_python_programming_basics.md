# Chapter 2. Python Programming Basics

In Chapter 1, we explored the context behind programming:

why computers exist, what computer engineering aims to accomplish, and how programming functions as a tool for solving real-world problems.

Now, in Chapter 2, we shift from concepts to practice.

This chapter establishes the essential foundations that every Python program is built upon.

You are not learning “syntax” for its own sake.

You are learning **how to express a solution to a problem in the language of Python.**

## Why Python Basics Matter

Every advanced topic in computer science—data structures, algorithms, systems programming, machine learning, optimization—ultimately depends on the same basic questions:

- What is data?
- How is it stored?
- How do we operate on it?
- How does a program decide what to do next?
- How do we handle unexpected situations?
- How do we structure code so that both humans and machines can understand it clearly?
## What This Chapter Covers

- **Data and Variables**
- **Basic Data Types**
- **Operators and Expressions**
- **Input and Output**
- **Control Flow**
- **Functions**
- **Basic Error Handling**
- **Code Style**
## Learning Philosophy

Each concept exists because it solves a specific problem:

- Variables give names to data.
- Data types define how information behaves.
- Control flow allows decisions.
- Functions allow modular design.
- Error handling protects programs from failure.


Ask yourself:

**“What problem does this concept solve?”**
