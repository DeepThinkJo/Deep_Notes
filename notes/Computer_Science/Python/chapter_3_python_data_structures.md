# Chapter 3 — Python Data Structures: Organizing Information for Problem Solving

In Chapter 2, we learned how Python represents data at the most fundamental level.

But real-world problems involve collections of information.

To solve complex problems, we need a way to store, organize, transform, and retrieve structured data efficiently.

This is where **data structures** become essential.

## Why Data Structures Matter

Data structures determine:

- how quickly we can access information
- whether duplicates are allowed
- whether order matters
- whether data can be modified
- how easy it is to transform data
- how stable a program remains as it grows


They form the interface between high-level logic and memory.

## Python’s Built-In Data Structures

- **strings (str):** immutable sequences of characters
- **lists:** mutable ordered collections
- **tuples:** immutable ordered collections
- **dictionaries (dict):** key–value mappings
- **sets:** unique collections


These are not just containers—they define how information behaves.

## Data Structures and Problem Solving

Real data requires:

- sequences
- mappings
- sets for uniqueness
- composite structures


Mastering Python’s data structures prepares you for scientific computing, data science, and AI.
