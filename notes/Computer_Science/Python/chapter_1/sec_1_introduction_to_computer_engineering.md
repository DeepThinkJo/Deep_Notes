# 1.1 Introduction to Computer Engineering

## What is Computer Engineering?

A computer is a tool designed to perform **repetitive, precise, and tedious calculations** on our behalf.

Computer engineering studies **how computers are built, how they operate, and how we can use them to solve problems efficiently**.

While computer science emphasizes theories of computation,

**computer engineering focuses on the design and practical use of computer systems.**

## Fundamental Components of a Computer

A computer consists of several essential hardware components:

- **CPU (Central Processing Unit)** — executes instructions
- **Memory (RAM)** — stores data and instructions currently in use
- **I/O Devices** — allow interaction with the external world
These components work together to enable computation.

## Layered Structure of Computer Systems

Computer systems are organized into layers of abstraction:

- **Hardware** — physical components such as CPU, memory, and I/O
- **Operating System (OS)** — manages hardware and provides system services
- **Software** — applications and programs written by developers


**Programming occurs at the software layer**, expressing problem-solving procedures that the OS and hardware ultimately execute.
