# 1.2 Introduction to Programming

## What Is a Program?

A program is a **precise set of instructions** that a machine follows to solve a problem.

These instructions must be clear and unambiguous so that the computer behaves exactly as intended.

## What Is Programming?

Programming is the process of **designing and writing instructions** that enable a computer to carry out steps required to solve a problem.

## Who Is a Programmer?

A programmer is someone who uses programming to solve problems by expressing procedures in a form the computer can execute accurately.

## Why Do We Learn Programming?

Learning programming is about developing the **ability to use computers for problem solving**, not about memorizing syntax.

Programming teaches us to define problems clearly and express solutions precisely so that a machine can perform them.

Ultimately, programming extends our problem-solving capabilities through computation.
