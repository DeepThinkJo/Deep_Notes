# 1.3 Introduction to Python

## What Is a Programming Language?

A programming language is a formal system for expressing **instructions** that a computer can execute.

It serves as an interface between humans and machines, allowing us to describe procedures clearly and precisely.

## Python as a Programming Language

Python is one of many programming languages.

It emphasizes readability and simplicity, making it suitable for both beginners and experts.

## Core Characteristics of Python

- **Interpreted** — executes code line by line
- **High-level** — abstracts away hardware details
- **Dynamically typed** — types are determined at runtime
- **Multi-paradigm** — supports procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming
- **Readable syntax** — easy-to-understand structure
## Advantages of Python

- **Rich ecosystem** with countless libraries and frameworks
- **Strong community support**
- **Ideal for AI and data science** (NumPy, pandas, PyTorch, TensorFlow)
- **Versatile across domains** including web, automation, scripting, finance, and scientific research
