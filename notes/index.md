# Deep Notes
*Deep Thinking. Purposeful Engineering.*

## What is **Deep Notes**?

**Deep Notes** is my personal knowledge archive for Mathematics, Computer Science, and AI Engineering.  
It is built on a simple belief:

> **Good engineering begins with deep thinking.  
> Understanding the “why” makes the “how” meaningful.**

Every page in this archive reflects a commitment to:
- **Deep exploration** rather than surface-level memorization  
- **Structured reasoning** rather than trial-and-error  
- **Purposeful engineering** grounded in fundamentals  

This space grows alongside my journey as an AI engineer.

## Why I Study in Depth

Engineering is problem-solving — but not just through tools or code.  
Real engineering starts with:

- Identifying the *core structure* of a problem  
- Understanding its *constraints and purpose*  
- Designing with *clarity, intention, and reasoning*  

This is the essence of **DeepThinkJo**, the philosophy behind this archive:  
**Think deeply → Understand fundamentally → Engineer intentionally.**

## Subjects in This Archive

This repository will contain notes on:

### **Mathematics**
- Linear Algebra  
- Calculus  
- Probability & Statistics
- Optimization

### **Computer Science**
- Algorithms  
- Data Structures  
- Systems & Architecture Basics
- Python
- C/C++

### **AI & Machine Learning**

## How This Archive Works

This site is automatically generated from my Notion notes.  
Every time I update a note in Notion:

1. The content is synced into Markdown  
2. Markdown files are pushed to this GitHub repository  
3. GitHub Pages regenerates this site automatically  

This allows my learning process to stay:
- **Consistent**
- **Organized**
- **Engineering-oriented**

## My Philosophy as an AI Engineer

**Deep** — Explore underlying structures and understand the foundations.  
**Think** — Reason before coding; design before implementing.  

Engineering is not only about building systems,  
but about building them with **purpose**, **clarity**, and **depth**.

## Welcome to Deep Notes

This is a long-term project — a living archive of what I learn, understand, and build.  
If you’d like to explore how I think and grow as an AI engineer,  
you’re in the right place.
